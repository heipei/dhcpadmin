DHCPAdmin
=========

Author: Johannes Gilger <heipei@hackvalue.de>

Description
-----------

A basic web-interface to manage the ISC DHCPD in our dormitory. We have both
fixed hosts (Zimmer) as well as dynamic hosts (Geraet). Besides basic CRUD, you
can comment and deactivate entries, which we found quite useful. Also: sortable
tables.

Usage
-----
You'll probably want to replace the name and logo of this project, and set up a
way to scp generated config-files to your host running the dhcpd.
